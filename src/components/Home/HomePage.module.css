/* In the updated styles:

The .container .box selector now includes overflow: hidden; to ensure that the video does not overflow the box when it's enlarged.
The .container .box:hover selector adds transform: scale(1.1); to enlarge the box by 10% when it's hovered over. You can adjust the scale value to control the degree of enlargement.
The transition property with transform is added to create a smooth transition effect when the box is enlarged on hover. The 0.3s duration and ease timing function can be adjusted as desired. */
